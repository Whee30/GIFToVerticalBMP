This is a script to take the animated GIFs downloaded through the divoom application and format them appropriate for this adafruit project: https://learn.adafruit.com/32x32-square-pixel-display

The "32x32" gifs downloaded through divoom start out as 320x320. This script pulls the frames apart, resizes them to 32x32 and then stacks them vertically which is how the adafruit project ingests them.
